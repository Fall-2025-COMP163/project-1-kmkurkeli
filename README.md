# COMP 163 Project 1 - Character Creator & Chronicles
   Student: Kurkeli Kurkeli  
   COMP 163 - Section 5  

# Project Overview
This project is a text-based RPG Character Creator that allows users to:
- Create and name a character  
- Choose a class (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Cleric)  
- Automatically calculate character stats  
- Save and load character data from a file  
- Display complete character information  

The RPG world is designed as a frontier adventure where each characterâ€™s backstory and class determine their fate.  
The program demonstrates the use of Python functions, conditionals, and file operations.

# How to Run
To run the program, open the project folder in PyCharm and press the Run button,  


# Design Choices
Stat formulas were designed to reflect balance between class roles.  
For example, Warriors gain higher strength per level, while Mages gain higher magic growth.  
This ensures each class feels unique and strategically different to play.

# Bonus Features
- Added a Backstory feature that gives each character a short narrative background.

# AI Usage
ChatGPT was used to assist with debugging and to explain certain strings and blocks of code.
